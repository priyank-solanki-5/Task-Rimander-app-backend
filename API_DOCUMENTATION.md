## Environment
Create a `.env` in the backend directory with at least:
- `PORT=3000`
- `MongoDB_URL=<your mongodb connection string>`
- `JWT_SECRET=<your jwt secret>`
- `ADMIN_API_KEY=<admin key for /api/admin>`

## Run Locally

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev # or: npm start
```

Seed predefined categories and start in dev:

```bash
npm run dev-with-init
```

The server logs will print convenient endpoint URLs upon start. File uploads are stored in `./uploads/`.
